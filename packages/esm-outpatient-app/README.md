# Outpatient app

The `Outpatient` app is a package that provides capabilities to track a patient's progress as they move through a clinic. Users can see an overview of various clinic metrics such as:

- The number of scheduled appointments.
- The number of patients waiting for a particular service.
- The average number of minutes spent by patients waiting for a service.

Another key component of the outpatient app is the Active Visits table. This shows a tabular overview of the active visits ongoing in a facility. Users can add patients to the service queue by starting visits for them. They can also view information from the current active visits as well as the previous visit. Users can also change the priority and status of an entry in the queue from the UI, effectively moving a patient from one point in the queue to another.
