# OpenMRS Patient Management

This repository contains frontend modules for the OpenMRS SPA. These modules relate to registering and editing patients, searching for existing patients, creating and managing patient lists, managing patient queues in an outpatient setting and creating, editing and managing patient appointments. The modules within this repository include:

- [Active visits app](packages/esm-active-visits-app/)
- [Appointments app](packages/esm-appointments-app/)
- [Service queues](packages/esm-service-queues-app/README.md)
- [Patient search](packages/esm-patient-search-app)
- [Patient registration](packages/esm-patient-registration-app)
- [Patient list](packages/esm-patient-list-app)

## Setup

Check out the developer documentation [here](http://o3-dev.docs.openmrs.org).

This monorepo uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

To install the dependancies, run:
```bash
yarn install
```

To set up environment variables for the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a copy of the .env.example file by running the following command:
  ```bash
  cp example.env .env
  ```
2. Open the newly created .env file in the root of the project.
3. Add the environment variables you need. 

Note: These variables are currently only used for end-to-end tests.

To start a dev server for a specific module, run:

```bash
yarn start --sources 'packages/esm-<insert-package-name>-app'
```

This command uses the [openmrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openmrs) tooling to fire up a dev server running `esm-patient-management` as well as the specified module.

You could provide `yarn start` with as many `sources` arguments as you require. For example, to run the patient registration and patient search modules only, use:

```bash
yarn start --sources 'packages/esm-patient-search-app' --sources 'packages/esm-patient-registration-app'
```

## Troubleshooting

If you notice that your local version of the application is not working or that there's a mismatch between what you see locally versus what's in the reference application, you likely have outdated versions of core libraries. To update core libraries, run the following commands:

```bash
# Upgrade core libraries
yarn up openmrs @openmrs/esm-framework

# Reset version specifiers to `next`. Don't commit actual version numbers.
git checkout package.json

# Run `yarn` to recreate the lockfile
yarn
```


## Contributing

Please read our [contributing](http://o3-dev.docs.openmrs.org/#/getting_started/contributing) guide.

## Running tests

To run tests for all packages, run:

```bash
yarn turbo test
```

To run tests in `watch` mode, run:

```bash
yarn turbo test:watch
```

To run tests for a specific package, pass the package name to the `--filter` flag. For example, to run tests for `esm-patient-conditions-app`, run:

```bash
yarn turbo test --filter="esm-patient-conditions-app"
```

To run a specific test file, run:

```bash
yarn turbo test -- basic-search
```

The above command will only run tests in the file or files that match the provided string.

You can also run the matching tests from above in watch mode by running:

```bash
yarn turbo test:watch --basic-search
```

To generate a `coverage` report, run:

```bash
yarn turbo coverage
```

By default, `turbo` will cache test runs. This means that re-running tests wihout changing any of the related files will return the cached logs from the last run. To bypass the cache, run tests with the `force` flag, as follows:

```bash
yarn turbo test --force
```

### Unit tests
To run unit tests, use:

```sh
yarn test
```

### E2E tests

To run E2E tests, make sure the dev server is running by using:

```sh
yarn start --sources 'packages/esm-*-app/'
```

Then, in a separate terminal, run:

```sh
yarn test-e2e --headed
```

Please read [our e2e docs](e2e/README.md) for more information about E2E testing.

## Design Patterns

For documentation about our design patterns, please visit our [design system](https://zeroheight.com/23a080e38/p/880723--introduction) documentation website.

## Deployment

The `main` branch of this repo is deployed in a [demo environment](https://openmrs-spa.org/openmrs/spa).

## Configuration

This module is designed to be driven by configuration files.

## Version and release

To increment the version, run the following command:

```sh
yarn release
```

You will need to pick the next version number. We use minor changes (e.g. `3.2.0` → `3.3.0`)
to indicate big new features and breaking changes, and patch changes (e.g. `3.2.0` → `3.2.1`)
otherwise.

Note that this command will not create a new tag, nor publish the packages.
After running it, make a PR or merge to `main` with the resulting changeset.

Once the version bump is merged, go to GitHub and
[draft a new release](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management/releases/new). 
The tag should be prefixed with `v` (e.g., `v3.2.1`), while the release title
should just be the version number (e.g., `3.2.1`). The creation of the GitHub release
will cause GitHub Actions to publish the packages, completing the release process.

> Don't run `npm publish`, `yarn publish`, or `lerna publish`. Use the above process.
